# Kids Hack Day Fall Camp 2014

## Overview

Kids Hack Day is a global community of kids from all parts of the world building and programming things, hacking their toys and inventing things. Now this is called the Kids Hack Day Innovation Club. Right now there is one more Innovation Club in the world and this is in Bogotá in Colombia. The Innovation Club is a place you can go to if you want to explore and do cool things with technology. At the Innovation Club we like to take things apart, understand how they work and change them to do something different. We like to create computer games, build robots and build cool costumes that can blink in different colors. 

This second semester of Kids Hack Day Innovation Club is a bit different from KHD Summer Camp: It's longer and with smaller groups of kids divided in 4 days of week.


## Date and local
We have 4 groups coming each one on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays from 3:30pm to 6:30pm and 2:00pm to 5:00pm on Sundays.

## Groups 

### Monday 

The monday group like to do a bit of everything. Tobias was at summercamp. Last time they all built tentacles and tried to program a led and servomotor with the arduino. They all seemed happy about it except Alexandra who didn’t want to do anything and eventually will try the sunday group. 

### Tuesday

This is the girls group, Vivi and Moa are quite in to leds and optic fiber. Andrea, Leia and Maliqua had fun building a pumpkin tentacle and learning how to use the arduino. They did a scientific experiment with the led to se up to what speed the human eye can perceive a blink. There conclusion was that the limit was at 10 milliseconds and they compared the result with an scientific article online. 

Vivi and Leia also learned how to make a light saber module with a switch made out of Strawbees. Tutorial for this will be posted soon...

### Wedneysday

-Victor Nordlinder (takes a programming course as well: knows scratch. lite java, lite dot, lite javascript , ganska mycket html, 

This group is ambitious and full of ideas : they want to program. A canon shooting soap-bubbles, skiing-robot championship in november, do a walking robot that senses walls and turns around close to them. 

Oliver wants to know how to become a nerd. 

”Hackers are nerds with big glasses , they use quantum physics to hack your computer…

### Sunday
A lot of kids are new to making things, most of the kids had ideas for robots. And some are really into programming ( they know scratch). 

Daniil doesn’t hear and don’t like to use his hearing-apparatus, he reads lips instead so you have to make sure that he looks at you when you speak to him. 

Aldin has quite advanced robot-ideas (his father is a mechatronics-engineer). 

They are not always to careful with things ( some of the little bits disappeared and some got destroyed.
