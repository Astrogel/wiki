## Report

### Wednesday

We all started with cutting the model for the tentacle and it was everything good. After put the tentacle to work we binded it to some servo motors and they managed to make it work very fast. Murilo introduced one of the kids to QuirkBot IDE and the kid got very fast how to make the servo move according with the sonar output. Paulo introduced how to run code throught codebender and do the standard text programming.

### Sunday

We started with some minecraft papercrafting, folding and tryied out to put some LEDs inside the toys since we didn't have any vibration motor.

After that we split the group between a soldering workshop and Minecraft programming session.

Minecraft session was a bit complicated because we were 5 kids and 2 required special care: One didn't speak english and couldn't read or write in swedish and the other didn't want to talk in english (and got a bit aggressive). 

One of the kids interested on the Minecraft programming just dropped out after see the chaos in the beginning of the session.

Some of the kids were really really helpful handling this situation but we need more people involved, at least *one volunteer for three kids* on this sunday. We also need to set some requirements to kids to apply for this activity:

- Speak and read english.
- Bring their own computer or share someone's computer.

Anyway they manage to play around with the functions `box()`, `up()`, `fwd()`, etc as well as with the function `times()`. It was a nice ice breaker.

The soldering workshop aparently went well and kids got fun.
