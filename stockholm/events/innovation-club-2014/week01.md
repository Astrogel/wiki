Ask kids what are their expactations and for that already been at innovation explain what is about.

Talk about what we are and our programs
- This is not a school
- They can work on their own invention
- Show videos and pictures from other cities
- Exibition of inspirational robots

Talk about open source and create githubs account for each kid to add them on KHD kids organization

Concept introduction: How to turn on a LED!

Free exploration
Fiber optics
Strawbees

Ask them to bring and think about halloween stuff

## Report

### Monday 

The monday group like to do a bit of everything. Tobias was at summercamp. Last time they all built tentacles and tried to program a led and servomotor with the arduino. They all seemed happy about it except Alexandra who didn’t want to do anything and eventually will try the sunday group. 

### Tuesday

This is the girls group, Vivi and Moa are quite in to leds and optic fiber. Andrea, Leia and Maliqua had fun building a pumpkin tentacle and learning how to use the arduino. They did a scientific experiment with the led to se up to what speed the human eye can perceive a blink. There conclusion was that the limit was at 10 milliseconds and they compared the result with an scientific article online. 

Vivi and Leia also learned how to make a light saber module with a switch made out of Strawbees. Tutorial for this will be posted soon...

### Wedneysday

-Victor Nordlinder (takes a programming course as well: knows scratch. lite java, lite dot, lite javascript , ganska mycket html, 

This group is ambitious and full of ideas : they want to program. A canon shooting soap-bubbles, skiing-robot championship in november, do a walking robot that senses walls and turns around close to them. 

Oliver wants to know how to become a nerd. 

”Hackers are nerds with big glasses , they use quantum physics to hack your computer…

### Sunday
A lot of kids are new to making things, most of the kids had ideas for robots. And some are really into programming ( they know scratch). 

Daniil doesn’t hear and don’t like to use his hearing-apparatus, he reads lips instead so you have to make sure that he looks at you when you speak to him. 

Aldin has quite advanced robot-ideas (his father is a mechatronics-engineer). 

They are not always to careful with things ( some of the little bits disappeared and some got destroyed.
