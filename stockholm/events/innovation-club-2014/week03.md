# Week #3

## Monday

### Report

This is what we did with the mondsy group:
-Monday group does now have the name "Stormtroopers" 
- Minecraft paper folding. The kids that did this cut it out and will put it together next time with possibilities to program LED's for eyes and will put vibrationmotors inside as well. Responsible: Isabella
- Cryptogame. Responsible: Isabella
- Theo, Tobias and Agathon did quirkbot crawlers using Kristofer's code for the carpet crawler that can be found here: https://codebender.cc/user/kristofer.hagbard - Agathon really got into the building, Theo became the hacker and modified to code to make it not rest and move faster. 
- The rest of the kids built games in scratch and code.org . Code.org work excellent for kids who doesn't have good readingskills ( Karin Nyg√•rds also gaved some other suggestions that I will try out). The youngest kids manage to do the programming there even better than his older brother. One kid helped to teach as well. 

Also good to know: It is managable for 1 person to keep the first part alone, we tried it yesterday since Carl had some important stuff to do for the Reach For Change hackaton. It only requires a little bit of organisation. 

2) I suggest that we will start cleaning with the kids around 18.00 (takes some time before they disconnect from activities). They should at least put back the stuff they have been using. If any time remains we could have a little assembly with them after

### For next week

-We will see who did the fastest crawler
-I will ask the kids to come up with ideas for robot-projects and maybe start with some building
-We will do some messages with the crypto the kids did, put them up and see if anyone manages to break our code...
-We will do some algorithm-games from CS-unplugged
-We will continue with some programming


## Tuesday

### Agenda

Build the buttons for Reach For Change hackathon

### Report
Only to kids could come (the rest where away on vacation). We dedicated the time to get started with some basics in programming. We also did a cryptology game and the girls named there group "the bubble hackers". Vivi warned us that she will become so good at programming so she can hack into our computers. I encouraged her to aim for that :)

## Sunday

### Agenda

Install ScriptCraft server on their own computers and present 2 or 3 challenges to them. For the crafting group we should make a paper toy race using the same principle of the brush bots.

### Report

We ended up not installing ScriptCraft servers locally but using the server at khdminecraft.no-ip.org. This server is setup on adventure mode, so no one can build or destroy any block. It is also setup on classroom mode so everyone can run code on chat.

The goal with this world was push kids to use the code to build and erase things on world. The activity we did was draw a "game level" on a paper and try to draw it using the Drone object. Everyone got excited with the idea of building their own adventure map.

The dificulties was that the code become too big and we can paste it on chat. Also was hard and boring when they started, we might need more fun ways to ask them boring tasks. 
The sollution was break the code in small functions, declare them one by one, use a variable as reference for the drone object and then call all the functions.
Nobody could execute the whole code yet but they are way more familiar with the basic comands like `box()`, `fwd()`, `left()`, etc.

For programming they downloaded TextMate and Notepad++.

They can access the server from their homes and Murilo has their emails. During the week they will receive an email with the Kids Wiki, more documentation and a quick follow up.
