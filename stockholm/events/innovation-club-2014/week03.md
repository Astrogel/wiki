# Week #3

## Agenda

### Monday
This is what we did with the mondsy group:
-Monday group does now have the name "Stormtroopers" 
- Minecraft paper folding. The kids that did this cut it out and will put it together next time with possibilities to program LED's for eyes and will put vibrationmotors inside as well. Responsible: Isabella
- Cryptogame. Responsible: Isabella
- Theo, Tobias and Agathon did quirkbot crawlers using Kristofer's code for the carpet crawler that can be found here: https://codebender.cc/user/kristofer.hagbard - Agathon really got into the building, Theo became the hacker and modified to code to make it not rest and move faster. 
- The rest of the kids built games in scratch and code.org . Code.org work excellent for kids who doesn't have good readingskills ( Karin Nyg√•rds also gaved some other suggestions that I will try out). The youngest kids manage to do the programming there even better than his older brother. One kid helped to teach as well. 

Also good to know: It is managable for 1 person to keep the first part alone, we tried it yesterday since Carl had some important stuff to do for the Reach For Change hackaton. It only requires a little bit of organisation. 

2) I suggest that we will start cleaning with the kids around 18.00 (takes some time before they disconnect from activities). They should at least put back the stuff they have been using. If any time remains we could have a little assembly with them after

For next week: 
-We will see who did the fastest crawler
-I will ask the kids to come up with ideas for robot-projects and maybe start with some building
-We will do some messages with the crypto the kids did, put them up and see if anyone manages to break our code...
-We will do some algorithm-games from CS-unplugged
-We will continue with some programming


### Tuesday
Build the buttons for Reach For Change hackathon

### Wednesday
Keep programming the robots.

### Sunday
Install ScriptCraft server on their own computers and present 2 or 3 challenges to them. For the crafting group we should make a paper toy race using the same principle of the brush bots.
