# Week #4

## Monday

### Agenda

- We will see who did the fastest crawler
- I will ask the kids to come up with ideas for robot-projects and maybe start with some building
- We will do some messages with the crypto the kids did, put them up and see if anyone manages to break our code...
- We will do some algorithm-games from CS-unplugged
- We will continue with some programming

### Report

We didn't get to test who did the fastest crawler. Isabella was doing some programming in the office room while the others were building 5 Kano computers and testing them on 1 screen. 3 groups got to install, name and test their computer. 2 groups still have this activity left to do. Watching the kids put together the Kano was amazing. It forces them to use command line and it gives them such a high confidence they believe they can program anything. The kano OS also comes with a lot of amazing tools to get kids into programming, such as a kind of minecraft scratch version, as well as programming a bunch of games and god knows what else :)

Wille was also teaching Samuel more advanced programming in Java. Wille also held a maker studio where Daniel was filming and Wille interviewing kids based on the briefs for Reach For Change. This was a lot of fun and Wille was acting as a proper little talk show host. "Late nights with Wille" :)
